Download and Extract to delete free time. Or just use the website. <br> <br>
Forked from <a href="https://github.com/Trixter9994/Cookie-Clicker-Source-Code">here</a>. Modified ever so slightly so I can use it in an iframe. <br>
You can find it deployed on Firebase <a href="">here</a>.<br><br>
<!-- Well guess what, 2.021 came out... what happened to 2.020??  -->
